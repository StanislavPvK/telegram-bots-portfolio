# Telegram Bots Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of Telegram bots developed using Python and Aiogram.  
All projects are specially created to demonstrate my skills for freelance clients.

Documentation, code comments, and screenshots of bot functionality are available in both Russian and English versions.

## Repository Structure

- `rus/` – Russian-language versions of all projects (documentation, code comments, bot messages, buttons, etc.)
- `eng/` – English-language versions of all projects

Each folder contains 5 project directories, each with its own README, plus an overall README for the folder.

## Projects Overview

1. **TudoBot** – a simple task planner bot (add, track, delete tasks)  
2. **QuizBot** – a bot for quizzes with category selection and scoring  
3. **CryptoPricBot** – real-time cryptocurrency price tracker (BTC, ETH, LTC)  
4. **Check&Go** – automated bot for purchasing checklists via Telegram Payment  
5. **BroadcastBot** – mass messaging bot for sending notifications to all users

Feel free to explore both `rus` and `eng` versions.
